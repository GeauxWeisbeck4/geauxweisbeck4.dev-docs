## Tar Heel Dev Studio - Version 1.0.0

I won't go into too much detail, but the very first rendititon of this website was quite beautiful I thought. **Tar Heel Dev Studio 1.0.0** was unique - it didn't have like any white space because I used hero patterns all in the background instead of white space, which I personally liked. I don't know if others liked it so much. My old pal Lazy.lad didn't seem to like it, but most other people did like it - hey you can't please everyone!

## Tar Heel Dev Studio - Version 1.0.1

This version was O.K., but it wasn't my favorite. I used a template off of CloudCannon CMS so I could get my website implemented quickly and I could start marketing as soon as possible. Big mistake - well sorta. My visits went up, but people didn't last on the page for a minute. It was a good looking website, but kinda boring if you ask me. I do like the design of it but I think I just lacked effort while creating content, design, etc. You gotta do your own websites yourself when your a web developer. That brings us to 2.0!
