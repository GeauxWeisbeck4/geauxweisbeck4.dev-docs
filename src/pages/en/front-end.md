# Learning Front End Web Development

**If you've ever played football, you'll understand and appreciate this analogy**

When you first sign up to play small fry football in fifth grade, it is one of the most exciting/confidence shattering times of your life. You've probably spent the earlier part of your life watching the Dallas Cowboys snort cocaine, score touchdowns, and beat the Buffalo Bills every year in the Super Bowl. So joining small fry football is the coolest thing you've ever done because YOU are going to be EXACTLY like those receivers, running backs, and the quarterback - no matter your size.

Oh the excitement - that is until the first day of actually wearing pads. Things go from dreamy to a fucking nightmare in minutes. First the coach tells you to do pushups with those stupid fucking metal clunkers and it's impossible and you're also suffocating from your chinstrap buckled down against your wind pipe. You also notice the coaches are screaming for no reason (huh, they were just so nice right before practice?) and just called you a pansy and said to run a mile in your 15 pound pads. You waddle a mile and come back, dripping in sweat and ready to call mom to come get you. Too bad because its bears in the den time!

Bears in the Den - one football player holds one football, while one other football player does not. Each player sprints at each other as fast as they can while the other players slam at the football trying to punch it loose and the other ones try to hit the tackler in the nuts. Nobody has ever actually been hit before so both players go full speed ahead until they collide and the bigger one bowls over the smaller player. _You've never felt so much pain in your life. What happened to the Dallas Cowboys and scoring touchdowns and coc.._ "WAKE UP!" Your coach is screaming at you. Football isn't quite like you imagined...

## The Analogy

Ok, sorry for going off on a tangent - I um, have some trauma to work through. But my point here is this - front end development is just like small fry tackle football. You think you want to go be a Dallas Cowboy, looking fancy and spiking the ball for touchdowns - but really you would rather be one of the cheerleaders. Actually, fuck that - they work really, really hard. You want to be a non-racist Jerry Jones is what you want to be, sipping scotch at 8 am everyday.

Front end development seems so cool and artsy and awesome and fun! But I give you one week of fucking around with CSS and HTML and JavaScript and you will want to throw it in the shitter. Back end development is surprisingly so much more fun than front end development. This may be a controversial opinion but it is just so much easier. Front end development is much more satisfying - but it is so much fucking harder. There's 98,000 React libraries, 10 million JavaScript frameworks, and 999,000 CSS frameworks - it never ends. Just when you think you got it down, everything changes too.

If you want to be happier than me doing front end development - hear me out. Have low expectations for yourself, learn React now, and start practicing Leet Codes problems every day for 5 hours at least, for the next 2 years. Also, do a new project every other day or you'll get wasted by the India guys - they got their shit together. Just don't have high expectations and you'll be happy.

## But I think I'm gonna be good!

If you just said that in your head, I heard it go in my head like this:
**Whiney voice** "But I THINK that I'M gonna BE GOOD!!!!

No you're not. Not until you've been doing this for a year. You may design cool shit in Figma, but you can come back and tell me that after you've built a Reddit Clone with SSR Next.js and Node. Yeah, try that one!
