- ✅ **Search (powered by Algolia)** [ ]

## Getting Started

To get started, you can either fork your own copy of this documentation, or just grab a cup of coffee and ride along for the trip! These are a work in progress so if you are reading them very soon after I just deployed the second version, there might not be a whole lot here yet. I promise to try and update these as much as possible, but you know how things get.

If you haven't already, go ahead and perfuse my portfolio website. Again, it is also a work in progress as I just finished it at the time of the first publishing of these docs. There is still a lot for me to add. Once you are familiar with the site, come back and we can move on.

## Philosophy of GeauxWeisbeck4

I have always been a positive, gregarious, and fun loving individual who loves to create things and loves to solve problems so much, I almost can't stop causing them for myself. Web development was a gift in my life - one that I had tried to break into for a long time, but dealth with counter punch after uppercut of people knocking my dreams out. I finally had to have everything fall a part to start seriously putting in the work it takes to be a web developer. I'm still unemployed a year later...

But that's not whats important, as I always tell my fiance Lisa (the beautiful gal in my pictures in the about me section). She then disagrees and tells me I need to start making some money and leaves me all alone at my computer typing away in a lonely browser somewhere out in broke land. It really sucks being unemployed this long and being this broke - I hope nobody else ever has to experience this. I'm probably a one off though, although I have made a little money off of freelance projects with Tar Heel Dev Studio.

But that $100k salary job will come soon enough and it seems to be knockin on the door of my life with many different interviews. I just try to remember the real spirit of coding and creating things - it's what keeps me from burning out and keeps me alive every day when I sit down and open up Pycharm, Webstorm, or VS Code... well, or Nova, Lapce, Stackblitz, Replit.. you get what I'm saying.

## Enjoy the Ride

No matter what you do, enjoy the ride. Whether you're just reading my documentation, starting your own coding career, or preppin to go pick up chicks at the bar. The outcome isn't important (because it usually sucks) but the journey is, so buckle up and pay attention, smile, and give the cute girl/guy in your life a little wink to let them know that you are the man/woman.

Let's get into my coding career and learn some lessons about what not to do!
