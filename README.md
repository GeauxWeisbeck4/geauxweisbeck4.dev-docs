# GeauxWeisbeck4.dev Docs

This is the documentation website for [GeauxWeisbeck4.dev](https://geauxweisbeck4.dev) my personal portfolio website. These documentation pages are as much of a story and teaching lesson as much as they are about actual technical documentation. Hopefully the reader leaves this website feeling like they are smarter, not dumber.

## Sharing My Experience

I've found in life that the most valuable lessons are the ones shared by others who have gone before us. That is why I am sharing my harsh first year as a web developer - to hopefully help you be better than I was. Let me know if these helped you out at all!
